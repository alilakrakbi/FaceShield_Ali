#Ali Face Shield

In March 2020 doctors and nurses in Morocco were treating patients with corona virus without face shields.

This file is an improvement on the design made by the university ENIM http://www.enim.rnu.tn (École Nationale d’ingénierie de Monastir, Tunisie). And I did the following modifications:

-	Removal of assembly by plastic screws that are difficult to find in Morocco. (cost reduction)
-	Addition of a system of hooks for an assembly that can be done by the end user, instead of factory assembly. (cost reduction)
-	Addition of a system to avoid deterioration of the mask during assembly with small and large openings. (No need for training for assembly)
-	Modification of belt the assembly opening (round instead of angles) to have a longer lifespan. (quality improvement)
-	The goal is to have a face shield that can be produced in the machine and delivered directly without manual work. (cost reduction)


I am putting the files in open source in faith that people will use them to lower the risk of medical personal who are in front line with Corona virus patients.
